# 📚 Project: Predicting brain activity from arousal measurements

## 👤 Overview

This project accompanies the Bachelor's thesis:

> **Federico Sbarbati**  
> _Predicting brain activity from arousal measurements_  
> University of Padua, 2025  
> [Thesis link](https://thesis.unipd.it/handle/20.500.12608/84641)

The work investigates how variational autoencoders (VAEs) can be used to extract meaningful low-dimensional representations from fMRI and eye-tracking time series. The pipeline integrates signal processing, delay-coordinate embeddings, PCA, and deep learning methods for unsupervised modeling of latent neural dynamics.
